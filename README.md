# Regression Projects Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of X regression projects that I have developed to explore various aspects of predictive modeling. Each project demonstrates different regression techniques, methodologies, and datasets, showcasing my skills in data analysis and machine learning.

## Purpose
The primary intention of this repository is to:
- Provide a comprehensive understanding of regression analysis.
- Highlight the application of various regression models in solving real-world problems.
- Share insights and methodologies that can be beneficial for learning and reference.

## Projects Included
1. **Project 1: [Blueberry Yield Prediction]**
   - **Description**: Predicted yield values for blueberries using bunch of manipulation techniques.
   - **Techniques Used**: Feature engineering using Kmeans, Data Visualization, Stacking Traditional Models

2. **Project 2: [Predicting Abalone Rings]**
   - **Description**: Predicted ring values of abalone stones using bunch of manipulation techniques.
   - **Techniques Used**: 


## Conclusion
Through these projects, I aim to deepen my understanding of regression analysis and its applications in predictive modeling. I hope this repository serves as a useful resource for anyone interested in learning more about regression techniques and their practical applications.
